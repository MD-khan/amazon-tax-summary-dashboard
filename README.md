📌 Amazon Seller Tax Summary Dashboard
📖 Project Overview
Amazon sellers face challenges during tax season because Amazon Seller Central does not provide a yearly financial summary. Sellers only receive Form 1099-K, which shows total sales but does not break down fees, expenses, and net profit.

This project solves that problem by building a Python-based interactive dashboard that:
✅ Summarizes total sales, total profit, FBA fees, subscription fees, refunds, and other expenses.
✅ Cross-matches Amazon transactions with Amex bank statements.
✅ Allows manual input for China product purchases & donated inventory.
✅ Provides an interactive dashboard with financial insights.
✅ Generates exportable tax reports for filing.

📊 Features
✅ Yearly Sales & Expense Breakdown
✅ Profit & Loss Summary for Tax Filing
✅ Amazon & Amex Transaction Matching
✅ Expense Category Analysis (FBA, Subscription, Refunds, etc.)
✅ Visualized Reports & Exportable Tax Summaries
✅ Interactive Dashboard (Dash/Streamlit)
