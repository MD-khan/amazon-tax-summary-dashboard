📌 Project Proposal - Amazon Seller Tax Summary Dashboard
1. Project Overview
Amazon sellers struggle with tax filing due to a lack of a clear yearly financial summary on Amazon Seller Central. Amazon only provides Form 1099-K, which shows total revenue but lacks detailed expense breakdowns. This makes it difficult for sellers to calculate their net profit and tax obligations.

To solve this problem, this project will develop a Python-based interactive dashboard that:

Summarizes total sales, profit, fees, refunds, and expenses.
Cross-matches Amazon transaction fees with Amex credit card statements.
Includes manual input options for China-sourced product purchases & Goodwill donations.
Provides an interactive dashboard for tax-ready financial summaries.
By automating these calculations, sellers will have a clear financial overview to file taxes accurately and make better business decisions.

2. Project Objectives
✅ Automate Amazon Seller Tax Analysis
✅ Provide a Clear Financial Summary for Tax Filing
✅ Cross-check Amazon & Amex Transactions
✅ Generate Reports for Tax Filing
✅ Visualize Monthly & Yearly Financial Trends

3. Data Sources
To generate a complete financial summary, we will use the following data sources:

📌 Amazon Seller Central Transactions (CSV) – Full transaction history including sales, FBA fees, refunds, and advertising costs.
📌 Amex Statements (CSV) – To verify actual payments and expenses.
📌 Manual Input (China Purchases, Donations) – Includes external business costs such as product sourcing and inventory donations.

4. Deliverables
